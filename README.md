# The Epic 80's Quiz

View my Epic 80's quiz here (link)

This project I decided to make a simple quiz app using HTML, CSS and Javascript to test the user on my favourite subject - the 80's!.
The sole purpose of the quiz is to have a little fun and to give a reference to many of its quirks - especially pixelated fonts, sci-fi images and other cliches.

## Landing Page

The landing page of the project is simple and mimicing of an 80's video game. Similar to the restrictions of 1980's technology and graphics the fonts are old arcade styled and a simple animation on a button like you would see on an old style games console.
Rather than a standard 'Enter' or 'Start' button the player is invited to 'go 88mph' - a reference to the classic Back to the Future pre-requisite speed!
