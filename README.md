# The Epic 80's Quiz

View my Epic 80's quiz here (link)

This project I decided to make a simple quiz app using HTML, CSS and Javascript to test the user on my favourite subject - the 80's!.
The sole purpose of the quiz is to have a little fun and to give a reference to many of its quirks - especially pixelated fonts, sci-fi images and other cliches.

## Landing Page

The landing page of the project is simple and mimicing of an 80's video game. 

In designing the landing page I came up with a few different designs, however found that anything more than just a simple title and a 'start' or 'proceed' button was a bit distracting from the reason that the user is here. 

In order to highlight how to begin the quiz an animated button sits at the bottom inviting the user to 'Go 88mph'. 

## Quiz Pages

### Inner Theme

To keep a consistent and running theme the quiz page shares the same background as the landing page. This is quite similar to video/arcade games of the the 1980's with a static background and the only 'moving' parts of the design are in the 2nd foreground. 
Throughout the quiz the user has the option of going forward to the next question or returning to the previous question. 

### Color Scheme

Initially I wanted to keep to a colour scheme of only black and green - much like the earliest incarnations of MS DOS or early arcade games. However after looking at the typical home video games of the 1980's I realised there was much more of a colour palette used. However, I also noticed that the most popular colours weren't always overly complimentary. I also noted the popularity of shades of pink to purple. 

### Typography

Typography was a relatively easy choice - the lower the pixel aesthetic the better! For this I used 'Press Start 2P'. The font is reference to the low-res font found in early Commodore, Atari and even Nintento games.

# Testing

## User Testing

In order to test this project I allowed my mentor and a four friends a chance to play the quiz and navigate around to make sure all the buttons work. 

I also needed to check all answers were coded correctly in order to not give any erroneous results when the question had been answered either correctly or incorrectly. 

## User Testing Expectation 

* All landing page to load as expected
* All quiz buttons work
* Navigation buttons to work
* All correct and incorrect tallies to work

## User Testing Results
* Submit quiz/view results not clear 
* Should include a 'restart quiz' button

## Post testing Adjustments

After having the quiz tested I have adjusted the background of the results div in order to make the result more apparent. Previously the button was working however the font color and background were too close in color to view. 
I also added a button to link back to the landing page in order to start the quiz again.
